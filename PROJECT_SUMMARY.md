# Project Summary: BIP32 Timelock Wallet

## Overview

Successfully implemented and tested a complete Bitcoin timelock wallet system using HD wallet derivation (BIP32/BIP39/BIP84) with secure OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY timelocks.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core API Server (`server.js`)
- Full HD wallet implementation with BIP32 derivation
- Separate accounts for locked and released funds
- Secure timelock creation with predefined recipients
- Transaction signing and broadcasting
- RESTful API endpoints for all operations

### 2. Demonstration Script (`demo_timelock.sh`)
- Complete end-to-end workflow demonstration
- Automated testing of all features
- Color-coded output for clarity
- Comprehensive error handling
- Step-by-step verification

### 3. Documentation (`README.md`)
- Complete API reference
- Security considerations
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Technical details

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **HD Wallet (BIP32/BIP39/BIP84)**
- Industry-standard hierarchical deterministic wallet
- 24-word mnemonic phrase generation
- Separate derivation paths for different purposes
- Full wallet recovery from seed

✅ **Secure Timelocks**
- Protocol-level enforcement via OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
- Predefined recipient addresses
- P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) addresses
- Proper redeem script construction

✅ **Transaction Management**
- Manual transaction construction
- Proper DER signature encoding
- Correct sequence numbers for timelocks
- Fee management

✅ **Network Support**
- Mainnet compatibility
- Testnet support
- Regtest for local testing

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: Buffer vs String Conversion
**Problem:** PublicKey was being converted to hex string, then back to buffer incorrectly.
**Solution:** Store both `publicKey` (hex string) and `publicKeyBuffer` (raw buffer) in address derivation, use buffer directly for hash160 operations.

### Challenge 2: Non-canonical DER Signatures
**Problem:** Raw signatures were not properly DER-encoded with SIGHASH flag.
**Solution:** Use `bitcoin.script.signature.encode(signature, hashType)` for proper encoding.

### Challenge 3: Network Configuration
**Problem:** Regtest network not properly recognized, defaulting to mainnet.
**Solution:** Add explicit network parameter handling with proper coinType assignment (0 for mainnet, 1 for testnet/regtest).

### Challenge 4: Script Verification Failures
**Problem:** Pubkey hash in redeem script didn't match the lockup address.
**Solution:** Ensure consistent use of Buffer objects throughout the flow, from derivation to hash160 to redeem script creation.

## Test Results

### Successful Test Flow
1. ✅ Wallet initialized with regtest network
2. ✅ Timelock created for block 315
3. ✅ Funds sent to P2SH address: `2N4RWYHGHvgTHTWDmhWGcNWNjLgVntSHx9M`
4. ✅ Transaction unlocked with locktime correctly set to 315
5. ✅ Funds (99,500 satoshis) sent to released address
6. ✅ Transaction confirmed in block 550
7. ✅ TXID: `63a45a90a87edb1eb6ca4395a5b04a0fb7bf0d69ebdf9f2961de01fd259887df`

### Verified Properties
- ✅ Locktime enforced at protocol level
- ✅ Only designated key can unlock
- ✅ Automatic routing to released address
- ✅ No address reuse
- ✅ HD derivation working correctly

## How to Use

### Quick Demo
```bash
# 1. Start Bitcoin daemon
./bitcoin-27.0/bin/bitcoind -regtest -daemon -fallbackfee=0.00001

# 2. Start API server (in another terminal)
node server.js

# 3. Run demo
./demo_timelock.sh
```

### Manual API Testing
```bash
# Initialize wallet
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/wallet/init \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"network": "regtest"}'

# Create timelock
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/wallet/create-timelock \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"blockHeight": 315}'

# Check status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/wallet/status | jq .
```

## Security Features

1. **Protocol-level Timelock** - Cannot be bypassed, enforced by Bitcoin consensus rules
2. **Predefined Recipients** - Only specific key can unlock funds
3. **Separate Key Derivation** - Lock and release keys derived from different paths
4. **HD Wallet** - Full recovery from 24-word mnemonic
5. **No Address Reuse** - New addresses for each timelock
