# Fund Timelock Button - Quick Summary

## What Was Added

A **"💰 Fund"** button has been added to each timelock card in the UI that allows you to send funds directly to the timelock's lockup address.

## Changes Made

1. **Proxy Server** (`proxy/proxy-server.js`):
   - Added `POST /api/sendtoaddress` endpoint
   - Calls `bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress <address> <amount>`

2. **API Client** (`client/src/bitcoinApi.js`):
   - Added `sendToAddress(address, amount, network)` method

3. **React App** (`client/src/App.jsx`):
   - Added `handleFundTimelock(lock)` function
   - Added "💰 Fund" button next to "Select to Unlock"
   - Auto-mines 1 confirmation block on regtest

## How to Use

1. **Create a timelock** (or use an existing one)
2. **Click "💰 Fund"** on the timelock card
3. **Enter amount** in the prompt (default: 0.001 BTC)
4. **Wait for confirmation** - On regtest, automatically mines 1 block
5. **Click "Select to Unlock"** - Auto-fills TXID, vout, amount
6. **Mine more blocks** if needed to reach unlock height
7. **Click "Unlock Timelock"** - Transaction broadcasts automatically

## Complete Testing Workflow

```
1. Create Timelock (block height = current + 10)

2. Click "💰 Fund" → Enter 0.001 BTC → OK

5. Click "⛏️ Mine 5 Blocks" (to reach unlock height)

6. Click "Unlock Timelock"

```
