# Auto-Mine After Unlock Fix

## Problem

After unlocking a timelock, the released address balance showed **0 BTC** instead of the expected amount:

```
Released address balance: 0 BTC at bcrt1qjd4k9gyfwszr9p6kdp2adhcuv0mszj8gmxf8rg
```

Expected: ~0.001 BTC (minus fees)

## Root Cause

The unlock transaction was broadcast successfully but **not yet mined**:
1. Transaction sits in mempool (unconfirmed)
2. `scantxoutset` only finds confirmed UTXOs
3. Balance fetch happens immediately → finds 0 UTXOs
4. Result: 0 BTC displayed

## Solution

Added automatic confirmation mining after broadcasting the unlock transaction (regtest only).

### Code Change

**File:** `client/src/App.jsx`

```javascript
const broadcastTxid = await bitcoinApi.sendRawTransaction(result.signedTransaction, network);
showMessage(`✓ Transaction broadcast successfully! TXID: ${broadcastTxid}`, 'success');
setStatus('Transaction broadcast');

// Auto-mine confirmation block on regtest
if (network === 'regtest') {
  try {
    const address = await bitcoinApi.getNewAddress(network);
    await bitcoinApi.generateToAddress(1, address, network);
    showMessage(`✓ Mined confirmation block`, 'success');
    await fetchBlockHeight();
  } catch (mineError) {
    console.error('Could not mine confirmation block:', mineError);
  }
}

// Wait a moment for transaction to be indexed
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));

// Fetch balance of released address after unlock
if (result.to) {
  await fetchReleasedBalance(result.to);
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Unlock transaction broadcasts** → TXID returned
2. **Auto-mine 1 block** (regtest only) → Confirms transaction
3. **Update block height** → UI shows new height
4. **Wait 500ms** → Allows Bitcoin Core to index the block
5. **Fetch balance** → `scantxoutset` finds the confirmed UTXO
6. **Display balance** → Shows correct amount!

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
```
1. Unlock timelock → Broadcast
2. Check balance → 0 BTC (unconfirmed)
3. User must manually mine blocks
4. Refresh balance → Now shows correct amount
```

### After Fix:
```
1. Unlock timelock → Broadcast
2. Auto-mine 1 block → Confirm
3. Check balance → 0.00099500 BTC ✅
4. Display immediately with correct balance
```

## Benefits

✅ **No manual mining needed** - Automatic on regtest
✅ **Immediate feedback** - Balance shows right away
✅ **Correct amount displayed** - Confirmed UTXOs found
✅ **Better UX** - One-click unlock → see result

## Network Behavior

### Regtest
- ✅ Auto-mines confirmation block
- ✅ Balance fetches after confirmation
- ✅ Immediate feedback

### Testnet/Mainnet
- ⏳ No auto-mining (can't generate blocks)
- ⏳ Transaction sits in mempool
- ⏳ Balance appears when block is mined by network
- 💡 User can click "🔄 Refresh Balance" after confirmation

## Testing

1. **Create and fund a timelock**
2. **Mine blocks to unlock height**
3. **Click "Unlock Timelock"**
4. **Observe**:
   - ✅ "Transaction broadcast successfully!"
   - ✅ "Mined confirmation block"
   - ✅ Balance card appears
   - ✅ Shows ~0.00099500 BTC (1000000 sats - 500 sat fee)

## Expected Balance Calculation

```
Input: 0.001 BTC (100,000 satoshis)
Fee: 500 satoshis (default)
Output: 99,500 satoshis = 0.00099500 BTC ✅
```

## Status

✅ Fixed in `client/src/App.jsx`
✅ Vite will hot-reload automatically
✅ Try unlocking again - should show correct balance!

## Quick Test

```
1. Unlock a timelock
2. Wait ~1 second for auto-mining
3. Should see: "✓ Mined confirmation block"
4. Balance should show: 0.00099500 BTC (or similar)
```

If you still see 0 BTC after these changes, check:
- Is the transaction actually broadcasting? (Check proxy logs)
- Is the block being mined? (Check block height increases)
- Is the correct address being used? (Check console log)
