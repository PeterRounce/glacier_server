# Mine a block
bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 1 $(bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddress)

# Get transaction details
bitcoin-cli -regtest listtransactions "*" 1
```

### Step 4: Wait for Block Height
```bash
# Mine blocks until height 111
bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 10 $(bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddress)

# Update block height in app
bitcoin-cli -regtest getblockcount

- **Update Button**: Fast block height update
- **Select to Unlock**: One-click selection

## 💡 Tips

### For Testing on Regtest
1. Start with low block numbers (100-200 range)
2. Use small intervals (+10 blocks) for quick testing
3. Update block height frequently as you mine
4. Keep terminal and app side-by-side

### For Mainnet/Testnet
1. Use realistic block heights (current + thousands)
2. Consider ~10 minutes per block on mainnet
3. Use blockchain explorers to check current height
4. Be patient - blocks take time!

### Best Practices
1. **Always update block height** before creating timelocks
2. **Save P2SH addresses** for each timelock
3. **Record TXID and vout** when funding timelocks
4. **Check "✓ Unlockable"** indicator before unlocking
5. **Test on regtest first** before using real funds

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Block Height Not Showing
- Manually enter it in the "Wallet Status" section
- The auto-fetch requires a backend (optional feature)

### Timelock Not Selectable
- Only "created" status timelocks can be selected
- "unlocked" timelocks are view-only
- Make sure you're clicking on the card, not just hovering

### No "✓ Unlockable" Indicator
- Make sure current block height is set
- Verify the block height is >= timelock height
- Refresh the block height value

### Selection Not Working
- The timelock ID is populated, but you still need to enter:
  - TXID (from funding transaction)
  - Vout (usually 0 or 1)
  - Amount (exact amount sent)

## 📱 Mobile Friendly
The interface is responsive and works on mobile devices:
- Touch-friendly click targets
- Scrollable sections
- Readable text sizes
- Proper spacing

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
Potential features for future versions:
- Auto-fetch block height from Bitcoin node
- Auto-populate TXID/vout from blockchain scan
- Transaction history tracking
- Multiple network selection
- Hardware wallet integration

Enjoy the improved user experience! 🎉
